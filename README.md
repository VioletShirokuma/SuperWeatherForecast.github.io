<h2>Description:</h2>

A weather dashboard application that utilizes the Open Weather app and an API key to result in a 5 Day Weather Forecast based on user input of City Name entered in the search box function. 

<h2>Learning Process: </h2>

This assignment better helped me understand Javascript and functions as well as the incorporation of an API to produce a functioning app, and implementing user input via AJAX and JSON data retrieval, and local storage syntax usage. Understanding of AJAX was an important learning process here as well as how to input the given information (weatern, temperature, humidity, etc).


<h2>Difficulties/Challenges:</h2>

* Some challenges faced was getting the Bootstrap to work out together with the data retrieval into the boxes on the index file.

* Getting the design and layout to smoothly function without clashing.

* Trying not to create too many unnecessary elements that may have gotten in the way, unfortunately very difficult as some parts of the app I cannot figure out how to execute.
